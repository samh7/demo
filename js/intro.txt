js interpreted
it runs directly on the browser
the syntax in standardized by ECMAScript
primitive types(no methods and immutable):
    1.undefined
    2.nll
    3.number
    4.string
    5.(symbol)
    6.boolean

typecasting(coercion):
    changing from 1 type to another 
    == - this coerces the types
    === - equivalent operator

Falsy values in js:
    1.undefined
    2. null
    3. +0, -0, NaN
    4. false
    5. idk

prototype inheritance:


the javascript first reads through the whole code looking for errors
variables and functions are hoisted in this process

closures are functions that refer to variables(only occurs with vars) declared by variable functions
closures may be caused by scoping
